# Provably Random Raffle Contracts

## About

This code is to create a provably random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticker
   1. The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw.
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
    1. And this will be done programmatically.
3. Using ChainLink VRF  & Randomness
    1. ChainLink VRF -> Randomness
    2. ChainLink Automation -> Time based trigger
